# Team & Partnership Notes

Append-only log, newest entry on top. Read this before starting anything that
touches people, roles, deals, or business decisions — it's the one record
that travels with the repo across every Claude Code session and every
Anthropic account, unlike `~/.claude` memory, which is per-account and does
not follow Daniel between machines/logins.

## Working practice — read this first

Any Claude Code session opened in this repo must treat this file (and its
history via `git log docs/team-notes.md`) as authoritative for
team/partnership/business context. When you make or learn a decision of this
kind — roles, access, deals, non-obvious business context — append a dated
entry below and push it, exactly like a code change. Per-account `~/.claude`
memory can still be written on top for fast recall, but never as the only
record: anything here has to survive a switch to a different Claude account
without Daniel repeating himself.

## 2026-08-26 — Monaim joins as 50/50 partner

- Monaim is coming on as a 50/50 partner on **Omnivaleur** specifically —
  not Somnia (his own e-commerce brand, unrelated) and not Revaleur.
  **Revaleur is Daniel's own vintage clothing brand; Omnivaleur is the
  software Daniel originally built to run Revaleur's own cross-listing,**
  later spun out into a standalone SaaS product.
- Structure is deliberately informal for now: no equity/contract yet. Legal
  vastlegging of the 50/50 is postponed on purpose until both sides are happy
  with how the working relationship actually plays out.
- Focus at the start: organic content for Omnivaleur's **Dutch-language**
  socials (TikTok/Instagram) — schema + ideation, editing gets outsourced.
  Also owns exploring a social-DM outreach system (parallel idea to the
  existing cold-email leadgen — see the `leadgen` skill for how that one is
  structured: find → first contact → log). Paid ads (his Meta/Google
  background) come later, see below.
- Suggested role/tasks: **Growth & Content Partner.**
  1. Weekly Dutch content schema for TikTok + Instagram — he floated 3 posts
     + 1 video/week as a first test cadence.
  2. Design + test a social-DM outreach flow for finding NL tweedehands
     sellers on IG/TikTok (VA-run vs. extension vs. manual — undecided).
  3. Track weekly content performance (views, follows, signups attributed)
     — this is what tells us when organic has enough signal to justify ad
     spend, not a fixed date.
- **When to start paid ads:** not yet. At 36 Supabase signups (mostly
  free-trial, some expired, a few test accounts) the trial→paid conversion
  rate isn't known or stable enough to spend on top of it — ads would just
  amplify a funnel we haven't validated. Wait until (a) there's a real,
  measured trial→paid conversion number from current organic + cold-email
  traffic, and (b) Monaim's content/outreach motion is running long enough
  to build some brand recognition — his own point from the original
  conversation was that brand-keyword Google Ads convert far better once
  people already recognize the name, which is exactly what the content phase
  builds first. Small-budget Google Ads (intent-based) before Meta, once
  those two conditions are met.
- **Free account:** `backend/services/billing.py` now recognizes a
  `complimentary` subscription status — unlimited access, no
  `stripe_subscription_id` required (see `evaluate_access`). To activate for
  Monaim: he signs up normally at omnivaleur.com with his own email (creates
  the usual 7-day `trialing` row), then Daniel sets that row's `status` to
  `complimentary` in Supabase. **Do not** use `status = active` without a
  `stripe_subscription_id` — that path is intentionally blocked (guards
  against a past bug where it silently granted free access).
- **Notion:** Daniel is giving Monaim full workspace access. No further
  restriction recommended given the 50/50 framing — gate by task assignment,
  not by permissions.
- The original onboarding document (product overview, brand colors/type,
  cijfers) was published as a Claude Artifact on 2026-08-26 and handed to
  Daniel directly in chat — not duplicated here since artifacts aren't repo
  files.
